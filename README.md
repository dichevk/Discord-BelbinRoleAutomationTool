# BelbinRoleAutomationTool-python
 
This project covers a case study on providing a way of determining Belbin Roles based on Natural Language only. The tool analyzes real sample Discord data, processes it and produces a visualized profile outcome. Although the tool uses Discord for the data, it is by implementation not constrainted to that message broker only (not bound to DiscordBot). The same methodology can be applied to other communication applications and SNSs.
